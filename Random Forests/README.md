#Random Forest Classifier

Instructions to get it working :

- Try compiling the main.cpp file. Most likely, it will fail.
- Check that you have the requirements installed.
- Modify the data.hpp file to reflect the training and testing file locations.
- Now the main.cpp file should compile.
- I'm not sure if a make file is necessary, if it is, I'll do it later.


*TL;DR - Wait till I finish the library*
