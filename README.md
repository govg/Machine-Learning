##Machine Learning library

This is just a side project. I aim to write from scratch popular machine
learning classifiers, in either C++ or Python. This would hopefully serve
as both practice in writing code and maintaining good practices, as well
as a way to reinforce my understanding of the theory behind the classifier.

If I suceed in making a decent amount of classifiers, I'll try and package
it into a single entity. This is in no way meant to compete with existing
packages or libraries, and is just an amateur attempt.


#####Random Forest Classifier

First one to be written, this works in a simple manner. For a good overview,
refer to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) wikipedia link.
